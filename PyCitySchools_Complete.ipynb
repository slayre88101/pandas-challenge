    "---Based upon the above data, one would conclude that Charter schools have a higher degree of learning and set students up for scholastic success. However, the data is skewed as Charter schools tend to have a much smaller student body than those of District schools. Larger schools, typical of district schools, have a much lower overall passing rate than smaller schools. Interestingly, the schools with more money per student have a lower overall passing rate. This comes as a surprise as one would expect wealthier schools to have a higher degree of learning as they can afford more teaching resources. "
